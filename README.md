# Advent of Code 2022

## What is Advent of Code?

- Advent of Code is a holiday-themed coding challenge run every year at [adventofcode.com](https://www.adventofcode.com/) with 25 days of coding challenges, split up into two parts, from December 1st through December 25th.
- This year's challenge can be found here: [adventofcode.com/2022](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/)

## Why participate?

- I ~attempt~ to participate every year to challenge myself to show off my proficiency in general coding knowledge and language-specific proficiency.
- Since Advent of Code is language-agnostic, it's a good way to practice working on languages that I may not be fully proficient in.
- This is also a good way for recruiters/interviewers to view how I think my way through a variety of problems ðŸ˜‰
